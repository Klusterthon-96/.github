# Team 96 - Agro Assistant

Welcome to the Git repository for Team 96's project, Agro Assistant! We've developed an AI model to help farmers predict the optimal time to harvest their crops, ensuring maximum yield and efficiency.

## Project Overview

Agro Assistant is designed to assist farmers by leveraging artificial intelligence to predict the best time for harvesting crops. Our model takes into account various factors such as weather conditions, soil health, crop, and location to provide accurate and timely recommendations.
